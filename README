Linky is a Sinatra application used to compare records in a MySQL database.  To
use, you'll need to install some gems first:

  gem install sinatra haml json daemons dbi dbd-mysql dbd-sqlite3

Then clone this repository, change directory into it, and run:

  ruby script/linky

Eventually, Linky will be gemified and its dependencies will be reduced.
